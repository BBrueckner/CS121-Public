		// Print the color object and verify the values. (You won't be using this with your song, but it gives you practice
		// instantiating various objects).
		
		// TODO: 3. Instantiate a new Song object called "mySong". Use the Song constructor with the following
		// parameters: Song(title, artist, album)
		
		// TODO: 4. Invoke the setFilePath method on you Song instance. Pass in filePath as a parameter.
		
		// TODO: 5. Invoke the play() method on your Song instance.
		
		// TODO: 6: Use the getPlayTime() method to find the playtime of the song.
		// Use the returned value to start playing the song halfway through the clip.
		// You can pass the starting point as a parameter to the play method.
		
		// TODO: 5. Create an alias for your song object called "yourSong".
		// Change the filePath of yourSong to "westernBeat.wav" using the setFilePath method and move the call to
		// mySong.play() after setting the file path on yourSong.
